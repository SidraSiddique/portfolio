# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate software engineer currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at PUCIT, where Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and data-driven solutions. With hands-on experience in Assembly Language, Python, and Database management, I strive to solve complex problems through code.

Key Projects:

University Management System: Developed in Python, this project streamlines administrative tasks by managing student and course data effectively.
Smart Data Aggregator: For a startup, I created a Python-based tool for real-time data analytics, using lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries to process large user datasets, track trends, and generate reports.
Creative Mind Project: Currently working on a data science project, managing tasks using Git and VS Code to explore creative solutions in data analytics.
Minimax Algorithm Implementation: Designed and tested an optimized algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe, incorporating decision-making for game AI.
Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A):* Worked on implementing search algorithms to solve complex graph-based problems, including puzzles and route-finding applications.
Skills:

Programming Languages: Python, Assembly Language
Technologies: Git, VS Code, Git Bash, MySQL
Data Structures & Algorithms: DFS, BFS, A*, Minimax
Web Development: Building an online pharmacy price comparison system
Collaborative Tools: Git for version control, Agile methodologies for project management
